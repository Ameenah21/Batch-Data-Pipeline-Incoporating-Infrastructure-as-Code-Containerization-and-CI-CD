# Batch Data Engineering Project
This project aims to provide a batch data engineering solution by leveraging infrastructure as code, Dockerized development environment, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline, and database migrations. The project is designed to streamline data processing workflows and automate the deployment of data infrastructure.

# Features
Infrastructure as Code: The data infrastructure is set up using Terraform, allowing for version-controlled, reproducible infrastructure provisioning on cloud platforms.
Dockerized Development: Run the data infrastructure on your local machine using Docker containers, ensuring consistent development environments across the team.
Cloud Infrastructure Management: Manage the cloud infrastructure with code using AWS CloudFormation or other cloud-specific tooling, enabling infrastructure changes to be tracked, reviewed, and deployed as code.
Development Workflow: Establish a structured development workflow with guidelines for code organization, version control, and collaboration.
Continuous Integration: Automate tests and checks using GitHub Actions to ensure code quality, detect integration issues, and provide early feedback.
Continuous Deployment: Automate the deployment of changes to production servers using GitHub Actions, ensuring efficient and reliable releases.
Database Migrations: Implement a database migration strategy to manage changes to the database schema, ensuring smooth and controlled database updates.
